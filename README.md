# Predicting-Salary-of-a-Future-Employee
With this regression problem, I am trying to predict the salary of a future employee given his years of experience. To build this machine learning model a company with collected a data from his/her own organisation which consists of 3 features that are Position/Designation of the current employee, Level/Years of Experience and Salary that they receive. Random Forest regressor model was trained over the collected data and a correlation was found between the Years of Experience and Salary. Using this regression model a new prediction was made on the future employee's salary with an experience of Six and a Half Years. And this model will also help the company to predict the salary of new employees that are willing to join the company.
